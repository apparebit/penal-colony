## Abstract

This paper serves as pointed critique of algorithmic practice outside the
criminal injustice system. Far too many interventions including social media's
content moderation are excessively punitive, often resulting in the figurative
death of users through permanent account suspension. First, based on my own
experiences and grounded in procedural justice, this paper starts by exploring
the many ways policy and automated enforcement turn punitive on the example of
OpenAI's DALL‚Ä¢E 2. Second, it illustrates how even best-practices policy turns
punitive performance on the example of pre-Musk Twitter. Third, a comprehensive
survey of non-Chinese social media demonstrates the pervasiveness of excessively
punitive content moderation. It also tests the limits of their accountability,
notably by projecting the likely impact of the European Union's Digital Services
Act and by correlating data released by Facebook, Google, and the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Fourth, to illustrate the limits of
algorithmic content moderation, this paper presents a successful strategy for
subverting DALL‚Ä¢E's aggressive automated censor, which inadvertently also
unleashed grotesquely racist imagery. Fifth, this paper proposes a new
intellectual property regime specifically for AI. It re-combines proven
elements from copyright and patent law, resulting in a framework that balances
the interests of those who invest in state-of-the-art AI and everyone else.
Finally, this paper concludes by pointing towards harm reduction as a mindset
for, possibly maybe, making life in this digital penal colony at least somewhat
bearable‚Äîbecause, I fear, we are stuck in it.


## Source Code and Supplements

Source code and supplements for the paper ‚ÄúLetters from the Stochastic Penal
Colony üèù‚Äù by Robert Grimm.

  * A [__custom build script__](build.sh) in the repository root takes care of
    repetitive tasks. The one optional argument is the name of the task to
    execute.
  * By default, i.e., when invoked without argument, the build script runs
    `pdflatex` and `bibtex` to __create the PDF document__ from the LaTeX files
    in the [source](source) directory.
  * Since LaTeX and BibTex are incredibly noisy in their output, the build
    script contains custom logic to __detect actionable warnings__ and then
    error out.
  * To work with the ACM's new (but arguably not improved) publishing flow, the
    paper uses only approved LaTeX packages and __compiles with `pdflatex`__. To
    produce my own copies, it also compiles with `lualatex` when the build
    script is given the `lua` argument.
  * Unfortunately, that leaves only one subpar option for __color emoji__,
    namely simulating them by including graphics files. I wrote my own LaTeX
    package, emo, to take care of that and then some. Emo is included with the
    paper sources, but may be outdated. Check out [its
    repository](https://github.com/apparebit/emo) or
    [CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/emo).
  * Transparency data and Jupyter notebooks with the code for __analyzing the
    data__ are inside the [supplements](supplements) directory.
  * The build script assumes that the __virtual environment__ with Python
    packages necessary for running the notebooks is contained in the `.venv`
    directory. When invoked with the `venv` argument, it checks whether that
    directory exists, creating the virtual environment and installing packages
    otherwise, and then activates the virtual environment.
