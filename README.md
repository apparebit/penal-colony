# Letters from the Stochastic Penal Colony üèù

Source code and supplements for the paper ‚ÄúLetters from the Stochastic Penal
Colony üèù‚Äù by Robert Grimm.

  * A [__custom build script__](build.sh) in the repository root takes care of
    repetitive tasks. The one optional argument is the name of the task to
    execute.
  * By default, i.e., when invoked without argument, the build script runs
    `pdflatex` and `bibtex` to recreate the PDF document from the LaTeX files in
    the [source](source) directory.
  * To work with the ACM's new (but arguably not improved) publishing flow, the
    paper uses only approved LaTeX packages and compiles with `pdflatex`.
  * Unfortunately, that leaves only one subpar option for color emoji, namely
    simulating them by including graphics files. I wrote [my own LaTeX
    package](https://github.com/apparebit/emo) to take care of that and then
    some. It's included inline with the paper sources.
  * Transparency data and Jupyter notebooks with the code for analyzing the data
    are inside the [supplements](supplements) directory.
  * The build script assumes that the virtual environment with Python packages
    necessary for running the notebooks is contained in the `.venv` directory.
    When invoked with the `venv` argument, it checks whether that directory
    exists, creating the virtual environment and installing packages otherwise,
    and then activates the virtual environment.


## Abstract

This paper serves as pointed critique that far too many algorithmic
interventions outside the criminal injustice system are excessively punitive,
often resulting in the figurative death of users through permanent account
suspension. First, based on my own experiences and grounded in procedural
justice, this paper starts by exploring the many ways policy and automated
enforcement turn punitive on the example of OpenAI‚Äôs DALL¬∑E 2. Second, it
illustrates how even best-practices policy turns punitive performance on the
example of pre-Musk Twitter. Third, a comprehensive survey of non-Chinese social
media demonstrates the pervasiveness of excessively punitive content moderation.
It also tests the limits of their accountability, notably by projecting the
likely impact of the European Union‚Äôs Digital Services Act and by correlating
data released by Facebook, Google, and the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children. Fourth, to counter any hope that doing better is a viable
strategy for addressing the basic inhumanity of these interventions, this paper
illustrates the impossibility of ridding ourselves even of punitive algorithmic
snake oil on the example of the October 2020 bar exam in California. Fifth, it
illustrates the limits of algorithmic content moderation through a successful
strategy for subverting DALL¬∑E 2‚Äôs aggressive automated censor, which
inadvertently also unleashed grotesquely racist imagery. This paper concludes by
pointing towards harm reduction as a strategy for, possibly maybe, making life
in the penal colony at least somewhat bearable ‚Äî because, I fear, we are stuck
in just that penal colony.
