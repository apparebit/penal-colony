\section{\DALLE~2 Imagines the Penal Colony}
\label{adx:dalle:fromkafkawithlove}

Figures~\ref{fig:dalle:gen1} to~\ref{fig:dalle:gen10} show a selection of
\DALLE's generations with prompts and dates. In my eyes, they successfully
balance content with aesthetic considerations. \DALLE{} did generate more
graphic images, but they also were less visually interesting.
