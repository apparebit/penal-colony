Sections~\ref{adx:dalle2:contentpolicy} and~\ref{adx:dalle2:terms} document
\DALLE~2's content policy and terms of use as of July 20, 2022. They It preserve
the structure and formatting of the original, with links pointing to the
Internet Archive. Note that archived OpenAI webpages may contain CSS that
prevents the printing of a full page and JavaScript that redirects to an error
page after a few seconds.

The content policy still is located at
\url{https://labs.openai.com/policies/content-policy}. It was updated on
September 19, 2022 by rewording the rules on disclosing the role of \AI{} and by
removing the fourth bullet of the rules on respecting the rights of others. At
that time, OpenAI also updated its notification for violative prompts to state
``It looks like this request may not follow our content policy.'' above the
cartoon shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:dalle2:cartoon}. Given this abrupt switch from
the inappropriately punitive to the inappropriately saccharine, one wonders
whether OpenAI sprung Dolores Umbridge out of Azkaban prison and tasked her with
content policy enforcement.

The terms of use were located at
\url{https://labs.openai.com/policies/terms}, were in addition to OpenAI's
general terms of use, and were rescinded on November 4, 2022.

\subsection{Terms of Use}
\label{adx:dalle2:terms}

Thank you for your interest in DALL·E. Access to DALL·E is subject to OpenAI's
\href{https://web.archive.org/web/20220729134013/https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/}{Terms
of Use} and the additional terms below. By using DALL·E, you agree to these
terms.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Use of DALL·E.} DALL·E can generate images (``Generations'') based
    on text input you provide (``Prompts''). You may also upload images to
    DALL·E (``Uploads'') and create Generations with Uploads.
\item \textbf{Use of Images.} Subject to your compliance with these terms and
    our Content Policy, you may use Generations for any legal purpose, including
    for commercial use. This means you may sell your rights to the Generations
    you create, incorporate them into works such as books, websites, and
    presentations, and otherwise commercialize them.
\item \textbf{Buying Credits.} You may buy credits to create additional
    Generations, subject to the payment terms in our Terms of Use. Credits must
    be used within one year of purchase or they will expire. We may change our
    prices at any time by updating our pricing page.
\item \textbf{No Infringing or Harmful Use.} You must comply with our Content
    Policy, and you may not use DALL·E in a way that may harm a person or
    infringe their rights. For example, you may not submit Uploads for which you
    don't have the necessary rights, images of people without their consent, or
    Prompts intended to generate harmful or illegal images. We may delete
    Prompts and Uploads, or suspend or ban your account for any violations. You
    may not seek to reverse engineer DALL·E, use DALL·E to attempt to build a
    competitive product or service, or otherwise infringe our rights. You will
    indemnify us for your use of DALL·E as outlined in our Terms of Use.
\item \textbf{Improving \AI{} safety and technologies.} You grant us all rights
    to use your Prompts and Uploads to improve our \AI{} safety efforts, and to
    develop and improve our \AI{} technologies, products, and services. As part
    of this, Prompts and Uploads may be shared with and manually reviewed by a
    person (for example, if a Generation is flagged as sensitive), including by
    third party contractors located around the world. You should not provide any
    Prompts or Uploads that are sensitive or that you do not want others to
    view, including Prompts or Uploads that include personal data. You can
    request deletion of Uploads by contacting \url{support@openai.com}.
\item \textbf{Ownership of Generations.} To the extent allowed by law and as
    between you and OpenAI, you own your Prompts and Uploads, and you agree that
    OpenAI owns all Generations (including Generations with Uploads but not the
    Uploads themselves), and you hereby make any necessary assignments for this.
    OpenAI grants you the exclusive rights to reproduce and display such
    Generations and will not resell Generations that you have created, or assert
    any copyright in such Generations against you or your end users, all
    provided that you comply with these terms and our Content Policy. If you
    violate our terms or Content Policy, you will lose rights to use
    Generations, but we will provide you written notice and a reasonable
    opportunity to fix your violation, unless it was clearly illegal or abusive.
    You understand and acknowledge that similar or identical Generations may be
    created by other people using their own Prompts, and your rights are only to
    the specific Generation that you have created.
\item \textbf{No Guarantees.} We plan to continue to develop and improve DALL·E,
    but we make no guarantees or promises about how DALL·E operates or that it
    will function as intended, and your use of DALL·E is at your own risk.
    Contact \url{support@openai.com} with any questions about your account, or
    \url{dalle-policy@openai.com} with general questions or feedback about use
    of the technology.
\end{enumerate}
