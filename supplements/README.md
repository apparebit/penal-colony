# Supplements for Letters from the Stochastic Penal Colony üèù

This directory contains the following supplements to the paper:

  * The [data](data) directory contains transparency data released by Meta and
    NCMEC as well as datasets capturing names, regions, continents, and
    population counts for most of Earth's countries curated by myself.
  * The [meta](meta.ipynb) and [csam-across-world](csam-across-world.ipynb)
    notebooks contain the corresponding analysis code. Run `./build.sh venv` in
    the repository root to create and activate a virtual environment suitable
    for running them. The notebooks are open source under the Apache 2.0
    license.
  * The [figures](figures) directory contains SVG graphics generated by the
    `csam-across-world` notebook.
  * The `extra-generations` directory contains unedited DALL-E¬†2 prompts and
    generations that inadvertently include grotesquely racist imagery. More
    details are in the paper. Please use your best judgement before accessing or
    reusing that material. That material is not only _Copyright 2023 by Robert
    Grimm_ (like all other materials in this repository) but I explicitly also
